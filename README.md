## 🧠 Models Implemented

### **1️⃣ Custom CNN Architecture**
A convolutional neural network built from scratch to serve as the baseline model.

**Features**
- Multiple Conv → ReLU → MaxPooling layers  
- Batch Normalization  
- Fully connected dense layers  
- Softmax output layer  
- Data augmentation  
- Early Stopping & ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks  

---

### **2️⃣ VGG19 (Transfer Learning)**
A classical ImageNet-pretrained network with excellent feature extraction capability.

**Features**
- `include_top=False` for custom head  
- Additional dense classifier layers  
- Fine-tuning of selective layers  
- High performance on small and medium datasets  

---

### **3️⃣ ConvNeXt + Swin Transformer**
Modern deep learning architectures combining convolutional updates (ConvNeXt) and hierarchical transformers (Swin).

**Features**
- Pretrained on ImageNet  
- Patch merging + shifted window attention (Swin)  
- Highly efficient and accurate  
- Fine-tuned classifier head added  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Images are organized in **class-wise folders**  
- Automatically split into **train / validation / test**  
- Data augmentation applied to training images  
- Works seamlessly with `ImageDataGenerator` or `tf.data`

---

## 🧪 Training Pipeline

Each model uses the same general workflow:

1. Load dataset  
2. Normalize images  
3. Split into train/val/test  
4. Build model  
5. Compile with Adam or SGD  
6. Apply callbacks  
   - EarlyStopping  
   - ReduceLROnPlateau  
7. Train the model  
8. Evaluate accuracy and loss  
9. Visualize training curves

## 📈 Results Comparison

| Model | Training Time | Accuracy | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Custom CNN | Fast | Moderate | Good baseline |
| VGG19 | Medium | High | Beneficial transfer learning |
| ConvNeXt + Swin | Slow | Highest | Best overall performance |

(*Update with your actual accuracy values later if you want.*)
